# StrongHold
Login &amp; Account Management Forged with Encryption and Security

While technology rapidly grows, security becomes the absence for those who don't take it seriously. Whilst it is great to create cutting edge applications which revolutionize the way we think, create and manage; what has happened with protecting these applications from being hacked or the protection of the user's information? <i>Security is not about having "things", it is about being able to handle them</i>. The aim of this project is to provide companies or individuals an insight and working code in order to protect the integrity of their information or software applications. StrongHold intercepts nearly all attack methods, providing secure account management tools and protects your company software from espionage and social engineering. Although StrongHold does claim to provide numerous levels of security, it is significant for you as a developer to improve upon these layers.

This Application 'CipherText' was created in JavaFX using 'IntelliJ IDEA', therefore when editing these files, you could use 'IntelliJ IDEA' to import the project folder or simply use your favorite text editor - the java files can be found in <b>/src/</b>. All code is open-source, but a reference to 'Milan Conhye' would be much appreciated. Continuing... [Coming Soon]
